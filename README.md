## Step 5: Wait for 10-15 Mins

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk will then automatically handle the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and automatic scaling to application health monitoring. After a few minutes, your environment should be up and running.

- Note: The environment URL will be displayed in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk console once the environment is successfully launched. You can use this URL to access your deployed Spring Boot REST API.
